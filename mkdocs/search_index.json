However, computational complexity of random field operations, globally unrealistic model assumptions like stationarity, separability, and isotropy, and data management issues when data size exceeds local storage capacity currently limit the practical use of the data in statistical applications and result in unshareable, irreproducible research. As an example, using global elevation data in the order of a few terabytes as covariate information in modeling the spatial variation of precipitation requires fast methods to inferential statistics and extensive effort in data management. In this project, we aim at developing efficient methods for geostatistical inference on global environmental phenomena that \n\n\n\n\ncomputationally scale well on shared nothing architectures, \n\n\nconsider non-stationary, non-separable, and anisotropic spatiotemporal dependencies, and \n\n\nare capable of integrating multiple data sources including remote sensing imagery and in-situ observations.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we will build geostatistical models that combine spatial Markov random fields with temporal advection-diffusion processes and adapt novel algorithms to the highly scalable data management and analytics system SciDB.
